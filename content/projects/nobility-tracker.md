## Project Overview

This "dApp" was created in the early days of "tokenomics" during the cryptocurrency boom of the early 2020s. It allowed users to log in and see exactly how they were earning tokens,
how many tokens they had, and how many tokens they had earned. The application was later acquired by the Nobility team and became part of their official website.

## Design

The application was built using VueJS and Nuxt, with a focus on creating a user-friendly interface that allowed users to easily track their earnings and statistics.
The application utilized web3 technology to allow for wallet connect functionalities, enabling users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and view their earnings in real-time.
The application also included a dashboard that displayed various metrics and statistics related to the Nobility project, including token prices, market cap, and trading volume.

## Lessons learned

- **User Experience**: Creating a user-friendly interface is critical to the success of a web application. It is important to ensure that users can easily navigate the application and find the information they need.
- **Real-time Data**: Providing real-time data to users is a key part of creating a successful web application. This requires a strong understanding of how to interact with APIs and how to update the user interface in real-time.
- **Security**: Ensuring the security of user data and transactions is a top priority for any web application. This requires constant monitoring and updates to security protocols to protect against attacks and vulnerabilities.
