## Project Overview

Quadzilla is an ecommerce store for the largest 4-wheeler part supplier in the UK. The task was to replace their existing shopify store with a custom-built ecommerce solution that would allow for more flexibility and customization.
The goal was to create a user-friendly and efficient platform that would allow users to easily browse and purchase products, while also providing the company with the tools they needed to manage their inventory and sales.
The platform was designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for future growth and expansion. The design was created to be user-friendly and provided a seamless shopping experience for users.

## Design

This application was built on a PHP backend utilizing Laravel which serves a VueJS web application. My role was to implement the frontend design and functionality, including the product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout process.
The application heavily utilized Laravel products for communication with the backend. I also implemented a custom solution for themes dependant on the current subdomain, allowing for multiple stores to be hosted on the same application.

## Lessons learned

- **Ecommerce Development**: Building an ecommerce platform requires a deep understanding of the ecommerce landscape and the needs of users. It is important to create a product that provides value to users and solves their pain points.
- **User Experience**: Creating a user-friendly interface is critical to the success of an ecommerce platform. It is important to ensure that users can easily navigate the application and find the information they need.
