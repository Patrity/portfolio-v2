Kronos was an online multiplayer game that I worked on, leading a team of three other developers.
The game was inspired by the MMORPG Runescape. The core was written in Java with some systems later 
converted to Kotlin.

Throughout the development cycle and launch of this game, I was able to utilize a wide variety of technology and learn 
many new skills including RESTful API design, game server architecture, and client-server communication.
