## Project Overview

Safemoon was a massively popular cryptocurrency project that launched in 2021. As part of the project, I was responsible for the development of a large-scale Minecraft
server called MoonCraft. The server was designed to be a fun and engaging way for users to interact with the Safemoon community, learn more about the project, and also earn rewards in the form of Safemoon tokens.
I led a team of six developers and managed a community of over 1 million users. We successfully implemented cryptocurrency rewards into a minecraft server and managed a large infrastructure to support the game.

## Design

The server was designed as a network, with a central hub server to manage player connections and over 30 game servers dedicated to different gameplay experiences. We managed 12 bare metal servers and multiple cloud serverst
to support the infrastructure needs of the game. The majority of the game server was developed in a mix of Java and Kotlin. We also created a RESTful API in Kotlin, utilizing Ktor, to handle data requests, player synchronization,
game data, and front-end requests.
We created a front-end in VueJS and Nuxt that allowed players to interact with their accounts while away from the game. This included a store for purchasing in-game items, a marketplace for trading items, and a dashboard for tracking rewards and progress.
We also created a web-based admin panel for managing the game servers, player accounts, and community interactions. This included a moderation panel for managing player behavior and punishments, and a dashboard for tracking server performance and player engagement.
Amongst the services, several custom Grafana dashboards were created to monitor the performance of the game servers, including CPU and memory usage, player counts, and server response times. We also implemented a custom logging system to track player behavior and
interactions with the game.

## Lessons learned

- **Infrastructure Management**: Managing a large-scale infrastructure is a complex task. It requires constant monitoring, updates, and the ability to scale up or down as needed. We had to ensure that our servers were protected from attacks and that player data was secure.
- **DevOps**: The project required a strong understanding of DevOps principles and practices. I had to ensure that our servers were properly configured, monitored, and maintained to ensure optimal performance.
- **Community Management**: Managing a community of over 1 million users is a challenging task. It requires constant communication, transparency, and the ability to handle conflicts and issues that arise at scale. We had to ensure that our players felt heard and valued.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Testing and quality assurance were critical to the success of the game. We had to ensure that the game was stable and free of bugs before launch, and that we had a plan in place for ongoing testing and updates after launch.
- **Team Management**: Leading a team of developers required strong communication and collaboration skills. We had to work together to ensure that everyone was on the same page and that we were all working towards the same goals.
- **Security**: Security was a top priority for the project. We had to ensure that our servers were protected from attacks and that player data was secure. This required constant monitoring and updates to our security protocols.
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Integrating cryptocurrency rewards into the game was a complex task. I had to ensure that the rewards were secure, easy to use, and provided value to the players. This required a deep understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.
- **Scalability**: The project required a strong understanding of scalability principles and practices. I had to ensure that our servers could handle the load of over 1 million users and that we could scale up or down as needed. This required constant monitoring and updates to our infrastructure.
- **Documentation**: Creating clear and concise documentation for the project was critical to its success. This included documentation for the codebase, infrastructure, and user guides. This required strong writing skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.
- **Analytics**: Tracking player engagement and behavior was critical to the success of the project. We had to create analytics dashboards that provided insights into player behavior and engagement. This required strong analytical skills and the ability to interpret data.
- **Monetization**: Finding the right balance between monetization and player experience was a constant challenge. We had to ensure that our monetization strategies provided value to players without detracting from the overall experience. This required constant feedback and iteration on our monetization strategies.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring that the project was compliant with legal regulations and guidelines was a top priority. This included ensuring that our cryptocurrency rewards were compliant with regulations and that we were following best practices for data privacy and security. This required constant monitoring and updates to our legal protocols.
- **Crisis Management**: Handling crises and issues that arose during the project was a constant challenge. I had to ensure that we were prepared for any issues that arose and that we had a plan in place to address them. This required strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think on our feet.
- **Networking**: Building relationships with other developers in the Minecraft community, influencers, and industry leaders was critical to the success of the project. I had to ensure that we were networking and building relationships that could help us grow the project and reach new audiences. This required strong communication skills and the ability to build rapport with others.
